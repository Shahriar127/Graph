## [Graph (BFS,DFS).pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/15937559/Graph.BFS.DFS.pdf)


This repository contains a comprehensive implementation of graph data structures and algorithms in Java. Specifically, it includes implementations of graphs using adjacency matrix and adjacency list representations, as well as depth-first search (DFS) and breadth-first search (BFS) algorithms.

Graph Representations


Adjacency Matrix: A 2D array where the cell at row i and column j is 1 if there is an edge from vertex i to vertex j, and 0 otherwise. This representation is efficient for dense graphs where the number of edges is large.


Adjacency List: An array of lists. The index of the array represents a vertex, and each element in the list at that index represents the vertices that are adjacent to the vertex. This representation is efficient for sparse graphs where the number of edges is small relative to the number of vertices.

Graph Traversal Algorithms


Depth-First Search (DFS): An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node in the case of a graph) and explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking.


Breadth-First Search (BFS): An algorithm for traversing or searching tree or graph data structures. It starts at the root (or an arbitrary node in the case of a graph) and explores the neighbor nodes at the present depth prior to moving on to nodes at the next depth level.
